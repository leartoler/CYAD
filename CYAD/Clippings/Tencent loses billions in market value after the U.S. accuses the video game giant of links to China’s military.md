## In This Article:

A surprise, last-minute decision by the Biden administration to designate Tencent as a firm with ties to China’s military has erased billions in market value from the world’s largest video game company.

Tencent shares in Hong Kong dropped by around 7.3% on Tuesday, following news that the Department of Defense included the tech giant on [a list](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-00070.pdf) of “Chinese military companies.”

The plunge erased over $35 billion in market value from the Global 500 company. (The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks technology companies traded in Hong Kong, fell 0.9%.)

The U.S. also alleged that Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL), the world’s largest producer of electric car batteries, had ties to China’s military. CATL shares, traded in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, dropped 2.8%.

The Department of Defense blacklist, first compiled in 2021, designates companies that the Pentagon believes are helping China’s military to modernize.

Other companies on the list include Chinese tech giant Huawei, chipmakers SMIC and YMTC, and drone manufacturer DJI.

The blacklist doesn’t place any specific sanctions on designated companies beyond barring them from serving the U.S. military.

Yet Morningstar equity analysts Ivan Su and Vincent Sun warned that the designation could lead to “reputational damage,” and dissuade companies from working with Tencent and CATL.

A Tencent spokesperson called the firm’s inclusion on the blacklist “clearly a mistake,” and noted the listing will have “no impact” on its business.

“We are not a military company or supplier … We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding,” the spokesperson said.

“CATL has never engaged in any military-related business or activities, so this designation by the Department of Defense is a mistake,” a CATL spokesperson said.

The battery maker will “proactively engage with DOD to address the false designation, including legal action if necessary.”

China’s foreign ministry blasted the decision on Tuesday.

“China is always firmly opposed to the U.S. side’s generalization of the concept of national security, the establishment of various discriminatory lists, the unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises, and the curbing of China’s high-quality development,” said spokesperson Guo Jiakun [to reporters](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-blasts-suppression-after-us-adds-tencent-catl-to-military-companies-list).

## How big are Tencent and CATL?

Tencent is China’s largest firm by market capitalization and the world’s largest video game company by revenue. It also operates WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging platform in China, and WeChat Pay, one of China’s most widely used payment services.
