## Game Description

Computer Space is a space combat arcade game developed in 1971 as one of the last games created in the early history of video games. Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering, it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game. The gameplay in Computer Space consists of you controlling a Rocket and attacking and avoiding the computer controlled enemy Saucers that are trying to shoot you or collide with you. You have an infinite number of lives, but each game has a set time limit. The object of the game is to have a higher score than the enemy at the end of the time limit.
