AY-3-8500 chip

The **AY-3-8500** "Ball & Paddle" [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") was the first in a series of ICs from [General Instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Instrument "General Instrument") designed for the consumer [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game") market. These chips were designed to output video to an [RF modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_modulator "RF modulator"), which would then display the game on a domestic [television set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_set "Television set"). The AY-3-8500 contained six selectable games — [tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis "Tennis") (a.k.a. *[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong "Pong")*), [hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey "Hockey") (or [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association football")), [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_\(sport\) "Squash (sport)"), practice, and two [shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sports "Shooting sports") games. The AY-3-8500 was the 625-line [PAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL "PAL") version and the AY-3-8500-1 was the 525-line [NTSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC "NTSC") version. It was introduced in 1976, Coleco becoming the first customer having been introduced to the IC development by [Ralph H. Baer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_H._Baer "Ralph H. Baer").[^1] A minimum number of external components were needed to build a complete system.

The AY-3-8500 was the first version. It played seven *Pong* variations. The video was in black-and-white, although it was possible to colorize the game by using an additional chip, such as the AY-3-8515.

## Games

<table><tbody><tr><th>Game</th><th>No. of<br>players</th></tr><tr><td>Practice</td><td rowspan="2" align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td>Shooting game 1</td></tr><tr><td>Shooting game 2</td><td rowspan="4" align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td>Tennis</td></tr><tr><td>Hockey/Soccer</td></tr><tr><td>Squash</td></tr></tbody></table>

Six selectable games for one or two players were included:

In addition, a seventh undocumented game could be played when none of the previous six was selected: Handicap, a hockey variant where the player on the right has a third paddle. This game was implemented on very few systems.

## Usage

AY-3-8500

The AY-3-8500 was designed to be powered by six 1.5 V cells (9 V). Its specified operation is at 6-7 V and a maximum of 12 V instead of the 5 V standard for logic. The nominal clock was 2.0 MHz, yielding a 500 ns pixel width. One way to generate such a clock is to divide a 14.31818 MHz 4 × [colorburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorburst "Colorburst") clock by 7, producing 2.04545 MHz. It featured independent video outputs for left player, right player, ball, and playground+counter, that were summed using resistors, allowing designers to use a different luminance for each one. It was housed in a standard 28-pin [DIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package "Dual in-line package").

## Applications

## AY-3-8550

The AY-3-8550 was the next chip released by General Instruments. It featured horizontal player motion, and a composite video output. It was pin compatible with the AY-3-8500. It needed an additional AY-3-8515 chip to output video in color.

### Games

<table><tbody><tr><th>Game</th><th>No. of<br>players</th></tr><tr><td>Practice</td><td rowspan="2" align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td>Shooting game 1</td></tr><tr><td>Shooting game 2</td><td rowspan="4" align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td>Tennis</td></tr><tr><td>Hockey/Soccer</td></tr><tr><td>Squash</td></tr></tbody></table>

Six selectable games for one or two players were included:

### Usage

The AY-3-8550 used the No Connect pins from the AY-3-8500, so it was possible to put an AY-3-8550 on an AY-3-8500 (without horizontal movement), and vice versa.

AY-3-8610 chip from 1980

The AY-3-8610 was a major update from General Instruments. It played more games (10),[^4] like [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball "Basketball") or [hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey "Ice hockey"), with higher-quality graphics. It was nicknamed "Superstar" by GI. It was in black and white, although it was possible to add color by using an additional AY-3-8615 chip.

Prior to producing the 8610, GI created the AY-3-8600. The pin configuration was the same as the 8610, but it was missing the two rifle/target games, bringing the total number of games down to 8.

The 10 selectable games for this chip included:

| Game | No. of   players |
| --- | --- |
| Tennis | 2 |
| Hockey/Soccer | 2 |
| Squash | 2 |
| Practice | 1 |
| Gridball | 1 |
| Basketball | 2 |
| Basketball practice | 1 |
| Two player target | 2 |
| Single player target | 1 |

### Usage

The AY-3-8610 featured a completely different pinout. It, too, required an external crystal oscillator. It still had separate video output pins, and removed the dedicated sync pin.

- An equivalent to the AY-3-8500 is the [TMS1965NLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TMS1965NLA&action=edit&redlink=1 "TMS1965NLA (page does not exist)") manufactured by [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments "Texas Instruments").
- The Soviet K145IK17 ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): [К145ИК17](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A145%D0%98%D0%9A17 "ru:К145ИК17")) has a built-in counter, making it possible to use a momentary pushbutton instead of a multi-position switch to select games. The handicap game is not hidden, it can be chosen among others using this button. Since a pushbutton occupies only one pin, this IC has fewer pins.
- A competitor was the [National Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Semiconductor "National Semiconductor") MM57105.
