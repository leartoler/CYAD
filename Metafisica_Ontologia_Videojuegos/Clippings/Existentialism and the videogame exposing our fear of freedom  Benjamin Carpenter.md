*What if our deepest desire isn’t to be free but to escape freedom itself? Philosopher Benjamin Carpenter, Visiting Fellow at UEA, argues that the Persona series — a globally successful role-playing video game franchise, having sold over 22 million copies worldwide — brings existential ideas to life by showing how our search for meaning is haunted by a longing to surrender the very freedom that defines us. In exposing our flight from freedom, Persona challenges us to confront the most uncomfortable truth of all: that our desire for control begins within ourselves*

The [*Persona* video game series](https://www.atlus.com/persona5/) has a reputation for exploring questions of personal and political identity. Who am I? What is the real me? What is the true self? These are all questions explored within these games. The series provides ripe contexts within which to discuss the self, identity, and the ways in which these are constructed and lived out. The Latin term *persona* —an ancestor to the word “person”—originally referred to the masks worn on stage by actors.

The lineage of persona-qua-mask remains central to *Persona 5*. Characters confront their inner selves by tearing off their masks to reveal what lies beneath—a ritual of self-revelation that captures the game’s preoccupation with freedom and identity.

Though Jung’s influence is evident, *Persona 5* is less about psychoanalysis than about freedom. The game explores how individuals assert or abdicate agency in a world defined by control. This essay reads *Persona 5* through existential philosophy—Sartre, Heidegger, and Nietzsche—to ask what it means to choose authentically.

*Persona 5* provides a vivid context for exploring existential concerns about how we live and the choices we make. At its core lies the question of agency: how we embrace freedom in a world shared with others.

***Persona 5***

The player takes on the role of Joker, who leads the Phantom Thieves, a party of teenage rebels who use their supernatural powers to reform corrupt adults, through Mementos, a vast multilayered dungeon in the form of a subway system that represents the general public’s unconscious mind. Throughout the game, the party has spent much time exploring this maze of shifting paths, fighting shadows, and changing the hearts of wrongdoers. Despite this, they know little about Mementos beyond its belonging to the metaverse, the cognitive reality wherein the Thieves summon their personae to face shadows and change hearts.

The cognitive world is a place of distortion—shaped by the warped desires of individual hearts. From the perverted PE teacher to the corrupt would-be prime minister, the Thieves have seen many twisted hearts, each taking the form of a palace that embodies each individual’s distorted version of reality. Mementos, however, resembles the Shibuya metro system and appears to have no ruler. It is connected to the collective unconscious—if not part of it.

Aside from the requests to change hearts, the main drive to explore Mementos comes from Morgana, the Phantom Thieves’ guide to the cognitive world. Yet Morgana cannot remember his own past, left only with a sense that he should be human and that his true self lies within Mementos.

Progress through Mementos is limited; each new stage opens only as the Phantom Thieves become more recognized by the public. This links the mechanics of the game with its themes of belief, and it is only at the end that the depths of Mementos are unsealed, revealing where the trains have been terminating. Entering the final path, the Thieves find themselves before a great gate. Upon passing through, they discover that Mementos itself is a palace—the palace of the general public, manifesting the collective distorted desires of humanity itself.

This distortion takes the form of a vast prison. Shadows are willingly incarcerated, clamoring to be locked up and resenting the Thieves for trying to free them. At the centre of this prison lies the Holy Grail, the treasure sustaining the distortion. When the Thieves try to destroy it, the Grail reveals itself as Yaldabaoth, a false god born from humanity’s collective cognition. What, then, is mankind’s greatest desire? According to the false god, we desire to be controlled, to be released from responsibility. His purpose is to grant mankind’s deepest wish: release from the burden of freedom.

**Sartre**

In staging its final confrontation against this god of control, *Persona 5* draws together its themes of freedom, justice, and resistance. What the game has to say about these is best understood through the lens of [existential philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/).

The desire to escape one’s own freedom is an existentialist quandary. Jean-Paul Sartre regards the individual as absolutely free. This is not to claim that human beings are omnipotent; there are limits on what we can do, but Sartre’s conception of freedom is concerned with our existential projects. Whenever we set ourselves goals or devote ourselves to ambitions, we are creating and sustaining meaning within our lives. Meaning is not something given to us; it is something we make. Freedom, for Sartre, is the ability to choose any project, whatever its outcome.

\_\_\_

Our excuses and bad faith must be overcome if we are to grow beyond who we are and become who we could be.

\_\_\_

*Persona 5* ’s confidant system illustrates this vision of existential projects. Over the course of the game, Joker develops bonds with others—his fellow Thieves and other figures in his world. These relationships with confidants emphasize the importance of choosing the course of one’s own life. Ann Takamaki sets herself the task of strengthening her heart and ultimately devotes herself to becoming the best model she can be. Ryuji Sakamoto trains to reclaim his athletic confidence. Others pursue personal goals—Makoto’s ambition to reform the police, Iwai’s wish to protect his son, Futaba’s struggle with social anxiety. Each begins from a distorted belief that hides their freedom: weakness, powerlessness, or the demand to conform. As their bonds strengthen, they recognize their own agency and the chains that bound them fall away.

Sartre’s claim that we can choose whatever projects we wish comes with a further implication: responsibility. We must always choose for ourselves; meaning cannot be given, it must come from us. Nothing can determine our projects but our own decisions. This choice cannot be avoided—we are condemned to be free, responsible for our own lives and actions. Authenticity comes from facing this freedom; inauthenticity, or bad faith, arises whenever we deny it.

Bad faith is not moral weakness but distortion, and this is precisely what *Persona 5* depicts. As the false god Yaldabaoth reveals, the shadows in Mementos wish to be told what to do, desiring neither power nor agency. The palace rulers, in contrast, crave power without responsibility. Both reflect the same flight from freedom—either by surrendering one’s will or by denying accountability for one’s actions.

“The act of making decisions is accompanied by nothing but pain,” declares Yaldabaoth. He is the distorted heart of a humanity that cannot face its own freedom, mired in bad faith. Humanity sees freedom as a burden, something to be escaped, and in desiring that escape it creates its own oppressor. Yaldabaoth is thus the God of bad faith, a lie born from the wish to be ruled. Though illusory, his harm is real: the ruin of a world that has chosen submission over choice.

To deny one’s freedom is to live in bad faith for Sartre. But the ruin is also brought about by the existential suffering of mankind, which can be understood through another framework — that of [Martin Heidegger](http://articles/spirited-away-meets-heidegger-we-killed-the-gods-with-technology-but-the-sacredness-of-life-is-continuous-auid-1104).

**Heidegger**

Though both existential thinkers, Sartre and Heidegger hold distinct positions on the self and agency. Heidegger’s existentialism is rooted in phenomenology, in which beings capable of questioning their own being— [*Dasein*](https://iai.tv/articles/[sitetree_link,id=]) —are understood as beings in the world. Despite their differences, both stress the importance of owning one’s choices and taking responsibility for them.

If Sartre helps us understand the distortion at the heart of *Persona 5*, Heidegger helps explain why it arises. Why do the general public resist their freedom and willingly imprison their hearts in Mementos? For Heidegger, the answer is guilt.

\_\_\_

To awaken one’s persona is to acknowledge freedom, to claim one’s agency.

\_\_\_

Heidegger’s terms often differ from their everyday use. When he speaks of guilt, he does not mean regret or remorse, but the structure of limitation inherent in every choice. We are “thrown” into a world of meanings we did not choose—shaped by culture, family, and history—yet we must still act within it. Every choice closes off other possibilities; to act is always to exclude. Guilt, for Heidegger, is the recognition of this finitude.

*Persona 5* conveys this through its gameplay. Joker’s [time is limited](http://articles/escaping-from-distraction-simon-glendinning-auid-2743) —he must choose how to spend each day, whether to build friendships, work, or train. Every choice opens one path and closes another. The impossibility of doing everything mirrors the guilt inherent in action.

The public’s imprisonment in Mementos thus represents a desire to escape existential guilt. But in abdicating their freedom, they do not escape choice; they simply choose not to decide. Their guilt persists, now embodied by Yaldabaoth, who rules over them.

In this sense, the people of *Persona 5* live inauthentically — both in Sartre’s bad faith and Heidegger’s “the they.”

“There are standards. Laws. Rules. Manners. Common Sense. Following those things is the only correct way of living,” declares one imprisoned shadow. For Heidegger, “the they” describes the state of being where one conforms rather than chooses. *Persona 5* visualizes this vividly: faceless crowds shuffle in unison through the metro, wordlessly following one another into the depths. They have faded into a mass of indistinguishable people.

Authenticity, by contrast, means taking responsibility for one’s choices—even amid the same structures that bind others. The Phantom Thieves ride those same trains, yet they differ through their commitment to live authentically, what Makoto’s persona Johanna calls “the path of strife.”

At first, each of the Phantom Thieves lives inauthentically, defined by oppression and distortion. Ryuji is ostracized for opposing abuse; Ann is manipulated and shamed; Yusuke’s art is exploited; Makoto is silenced by authority; Futaba blames herself for her mother’s death; Haru is used as a tool for her father’s ambition. Each has surrendered agency to others. Yet it is through confronting these oppressions that they awaken. “What denies you is an illusion… Who will you obey?” asks Futaba’s persona, Necronomicon.

Each character faces a decision: to accept distortion or reclaim freedom. Their awakening—the birth of their persona—is a mythologized version of what Heidegger calls “the call of conscience.”

Thrown into a world of imposed meanings, we often lose ourselves in “the they.” But even lost, we can hear the call of conscience—a silent summons to face ourselves, to recognize our freedom, and to choose. This call does not command; it demands that we decide.

In *Persona 5*, the persona’s voice represents this call. It speaks as the character’s own inner self, repeating, “I am thou, thou art I.” It arrives when the character faces their oppressor—a teacher, parent, or abuser—who denies their agency. The persona asks, in effect, “They tell you you’re not free—do you believe them?”

To awaken one’s persona is to acknowledge freedom, to claim one’s agency. Each Thief’s rebellion begins here. The contract with the persona is not a permanent state of authenticity but a response to the call—the beginning of living one’s own life.

Once one is awakened, what end does one pursue through one’s persona? Justice. Throughout its narrative, *Persona 5* continually returns to this theme. Yet justice in the game is never abstract or universal—it is personal. Characters speak of “my justice,” “your justice,” and, collectively, “our justice.” Justice is expressed through individual commitment and action, the way one lives in accordance with chosen values.

*Persona 5* rarely defines justice in moral or legal terms. The villains justify their crimes with self-serving rationalizations, and while the game condemns these distortions, it offers no single alternative. Instead, it relocates justice within the individual agent—an existential account of justice grounded in personal value and responsibility.

To reflect on one’s justice is to consider the kind of world one wishes to help bring into being. It is the outward expression of an individual’s existential project. Yusuke’s art reveals his devotion to beauty; Ann strengthens her heart to support others; Haru cultivates spaces of peace and community. Each vision of justice stems from personal meaning and creative purpose.

**Nietzsche**

This personal conception of justice resonates with Friedrich Nietzsche’s idea of the will to power. For Nietzsche, human beings are driven not by self-preservation but by the creative impulse to overcome limits and realize potential. We define ourselves through projects and ambitions that shape who we become. The [will to power](http://articles/nietzsche-and-the-myth-of-free-will-auid-2535) is not a will to dominate others but a drive to create and transform.

Nietzsche encourages us to see our lives as works of art—expressions of passion, discipline, and [self-creation](http://articles/nietzsche-and-the-perils-of-denying-your-self-auid-2325). In this sense, justice becomes the refinement of this creative force, the will to justice: the drive to align one’s power with one’s values and to bring a new world into being. The will to justice demands that one overcome oneself, transcending complacency and inherited norms to embody one’s own principles.

From volleyball coach Kamoshida’s abusive control over his students to Shido’s political ambition, each of the palace rulers embodies the pursuit of power without vision. Their palaces, temples to the seven deadly sins, symbolize distorted values internalized from a corrupt society. They are trapped in the very inauthenticity that binds the public—desiring dominance while accepting the world as it is. “You’re nothing but a criminal who rose above others by climbing a staircase of sin,” Makoto says to Shido.

Though obsessed with their own desires, these villains lack originality. They pursue power within existing hierarchies, mistaking control for freedom. Their narcissism masks spiritual stagnation. In Nietzschean terms, they remain enslaved to reactive values—those handed down by society and uncritically accepted. Their failure is not ambition itself, but the absence of self-overcoming.

Mafia leader Kaneshiro’s confession exemplifies this bad faith: he claims that greed is inevitable, that he is merely a victim of the world’s corruption. The Phantom Thieves reject this excuse, insisting that he freely chose who he became. The pressures of circumstance, they imply, only heighten the importance of choice. Freedom, even constrained, remains responsibility.

The will to power, refined into the will to justice, thus mirrors the existential freedom described by Sartre and Heidegger. To act justly is to assert one’s agency against distortion and to face resistance as a condition of growth. Nietzsche insists that struggle and limitation are essential—we require obstacles to transcend ourselves. Growth comes through the continual overcoming of a limited vision of the self.

**Awakenings**

*Persona 5* embodies this process through the awakenings of the Phantom Thieves and the evolution of their personas. Each awakening symbolizes the moment an individual confronts distortion and claims freedom. But even after this, growth continues. Through Joker’s deepened bonds, each Thief’s persona can evolve into an ultimate form—a symbol of self-overcoming.

The game suggests that identity is never fixed; each self we assume is a mask to be shed and remade. As we confront our limits, understand our power, and surpass what we once were, we take up new masks—not to conceal ourselves, but to [become something greater](http://articles/can-we-reinvent-ourselves-auid-1133).

*Persona 5* encourages us to acknowledge [our freedom](http://iai-academy/courses/info?course=heidegger-meets-van-gogh-art-freedom-and-technology) despite constant attempts by others, society, and our own distorted hearts to convince us otherwise. It warns us not to take things at face value, nor to surrender to those who dictate our choices or present necessity as truth. This is not a call to reject society or retreat into individualism. The game recognizes that we [exist only within relationships and shared worlds](http://articles/sartre-camus-radicalism-and-solidarity-black-lives-matter-auid-1602). The ruin of the world—a drama played out in every human heart—is our problem, however much we might wish to avoid it. Persona 5 calls us not toward a specific goal, but toward awareness of the structure of choice itself.

The game urges us to recognize the choices we constantly make, even when we pretend we have none. Our excuses and bad faith must be overcome if we are to grow beyond who we are and become who we could be. To deny freedom is to forge our own chains—prisons of the heart from which we must break free. This is the ruin, the domain of Yaldabaoth, and it is this cognition we must challenge.

*Persona 5* ultimately stresses responsibility—not just ownership of choice, but response-ability: the awareness of being in a shared world to which we must answer. Through connection, we reimagine what that world can be.

Speaking to the anxieties of modernity—the fear that we live in a fallen world beyond repair—the game mirrors the call of conscience, drawing us back to ourselves. It reminds us that our choices can reshape reality, that freedom endures even amid distortion. If we embrace our agency, we can be confident that life will change.
